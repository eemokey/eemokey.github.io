Hello, I'm Emily. I am a third-year PhD student at the [Melady Lab](https://melady.usc.edu/) in the [Thomas Lord Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Yan Liu](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Liu/Yan) and supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I'm also working with [Professor James Collins](https://www.collinslab.mit.edu/) in the [Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program](https://www.broadinstitute.org/infectious-disease-microbiome) at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). 

Broadly, I'm interested in building machine learning systems for the real-world with applications to biology, healthcare, and sustainability. My research interests lie in multimodal deep learning, interpretability and explainability, and generative AI. 

Prior to this, I studied [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-ba) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I was an undergraduate researcher at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) and [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/) co-advised by Drs. [Kristofer Bouchard](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/) and [Roy Ben-Shalom](https://roybens.faculty.ucdavis.edu/). 

Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm deeply interested and active in computer science education and community service. I was a mentor for the [Google AI Community Project](https://viterbik12.usc.edu/ai-community-project/) at USC, which aimed to build mentorship pathways for marginalized communities and foster the curiosity of LA youth about AI. Currently, I am a facilitator for the [Good Life Discussions](https://stem-ed.usc.edu/our-research/eerp/ethos-project/). More of my activities can be found in the [Mentorship and Outreach tab](https://eemokey.github.io/mentorship/)! I also enjoy [figure skating](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/category/figure-skating/) and [sunset walks around campus](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/category/photography/)!


I welcome all efforts to [get in touch with me](https://eemokey.github.io/contact/).
