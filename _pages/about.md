Hello, I'm Emily. I am a third-year PhD student at the [Melady Lab](https://melady.usc.edu/) in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Yan Liu](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Liu/Yan) and supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I'm also working with [Professor James Collins](https://www.collinslab.mit.edu/) in the [Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program](https://www.broadinstitute.org/infectious-disease-microbiome) at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). 

Broadly, I'm interested in building machine learning systems for the real-world with applications to biology, healthcare, and sustainability. Specifically, my research interests lie in multimodal deep learning, interpretability and explainability, and generative AI. I'm currently excited about integrating foundation models with domain knowledge for drug discovery.

Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate degree in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-ba) with honors at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). While at Berkeley, I was an undergrad researcher at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) and [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/), advised by Drs. [Kristofer Bouchard](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/) and [Roy Ben-Shalom](https://roybens.faculty.ucdavis.edu/), respectively. 

Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm deeply interested and active in computer science education and community service. I have taught in six Berkeley CS courses and faciliated the USC [Good Life Discussions](https://stem-ed.usc.edu/our-research/eerp/ethos-project/). Currently, I'm a mentor for the [Google AI Community Project](https://viterbik12.usc.edu/ai-community-project/) at USC, which aims to build mentorship pathways for marginalized communities and foster the curiosity of LA youth about AI. More of my activities can be found in the [Mentorship and Outreach tab](https://eemokey.github.io/mentorship/)! I also enjoy [figure skating](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/category/figure-skating/) and [sunset walks around campus](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/category/photography/)!


I welcome all efforts to [get in touch with me](https://eemokey.github.io/contact/)
