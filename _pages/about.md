Hi! I'm a 2nd year PhD student at the [Melady Lab](https://melady.usc.edu/) in the [Thomas Lord Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), where I am advised by Professor [Yan Liu](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~liu32/). 

Currently doing research on deep learning for data with special structure, such as time series, with applications to healthcare, climate science, and computational neuroscience. 

Prior to USC, I studied Computer Science at UC Berkeley and was a student researcher at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) and [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/). My co-advisors were Professors [Kristofer Bouchard](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/) and [Roy Ben-Shalom](https://roybens.faculty.ucdavis.edu/).
