Hello, I'm Emily. I am a PhD student at the [Melady Lab](https://melady.usc.edu/) in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Yan Liu](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Liu/Yan) and supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I'm also working with [Professor James Collins](https://www.collinslab.mit.edu/) in the [Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program](https://www.broadinstitute.org/infectious-disease-microbiome) at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). 

Broadly, [my research](https://eemokey.github.io/publications/) asks: How can AI systems advance human health? To this end, I focus on building multimodal intelligence that can leverage diverse biological data (molecular, genetic, patient records) to improve therapeutic strategies. My work rethinks critical healthcare challenges, from diagnosing diseases to creating new drugs, as problems that AI systems can effectively help address.

Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate degree in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-ba) with honors at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). While at Berkeley, I was an undergrad researcher under the mentorship of Drs. [Kristofer Bouchard](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) and [Roy Ben-Shalom](https://roybens.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) at [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/).

Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm deeply interested and active in computer science education and community service. I have taught in six Berkeley CS courses and faciliated the USC [Good Life Discussions](https://stem-ed.usc.edu/our-research/eerp/ethos-project/). Currently, I'm a mentor for the [Google AI Community Project](https://viterbik12.usc.edu/ai-community-project/) at USC, where we guide undergraduates in fostering understanding of AI within the broader campus community. More of my activities can be found in the [Mentorship and Outreach tab](https://eemokey.github.io/mentorship/)! I also enjoy [figure skating](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/category/figure-skating/) and [sunset walks around campus](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/category/photography/)!


I welcome all efforts to [get in touch with me](https://eemokey.github.io/contact/)
