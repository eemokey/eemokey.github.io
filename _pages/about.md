Hello, I'm Emily. I am a 2nd year PhD student at the [Melady Lab](https://melady.usc.edu/) in the [Thomas Lord Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yan Liu](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Liu/Yan) and supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I'm interested in building machine learning systems for the real-world with applications to biology, healthcare, and sustainability. My research interests lie in multimodal deep learning, interpretability and explainability, and generative AI. 

Prior to this, I studied [computer science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-ba) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) and was an undergraduate researcher at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) and [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/). My co-advisors were Professors [Kristofer Bouchard](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/) and [Roy Ben-Shalom](https://roybens.faculty.ucdavis.edu/). 

Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm deeply interested and active in computer science education and community service. Currently, I'm a mentor for the [Google AI Community Project](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/aicommunityproject/meet-the-interns) at USC, which helps educate LA youth and their families about AI. I continue to serve as an advisor for [Berkeley Undergraduate Research](https://research.berkeley.edu/). More of my activities can be found in the [Mentorship and Outreach tab](https://eemokey.github.io/mentorship/)! I also enjoy [figure skating](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/category/figure-skating/), [sunset walks around campus](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/category/photography/), and visits to my hometown in San Diego!



I welcome all efforts to [get in touch with me](https://eemokey.github.io/contact/).
