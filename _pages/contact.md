## Contact Information

emilyn98@usc.edu

emilysk8nguyen@berkeley.edu


*Note* From non-USC emails, feel free to CC my Berkeley email since USC's spam filter sometimes filters them out(why [some USC faculty](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kempe/David) provide their Gmail). 



## Doing Cool Things with Emily

**USC undergraduates, Mastersâ€™s students, USC affiliates** 

Please see this [research interest form](https://forms.gle/FQEM4d3LvAEPBmC79). I encourage inquiries from students at all levels and experiences.
