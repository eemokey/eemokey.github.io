For non-USC emails, feel free to CC my Berkeley email since USC's spam filter sometimes filter them (why [some USC faculty](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kempe/David) provide their Gmail). 



**Doing Cool Things with Emily**

For research opportunities, please see this [interest form](https://forms.gle/FQEM4d3LvAEPBmC79). I especially encourage inquiries from students who self-identify as groups underrepresented in computer science.
