# Mentorship 



## Research Mentorship

### USC undergraduates, Mastersâ€™s students, USC affiliates

Please see this [project interest form](https://forms.gle/FQEM4d3LvAEPBmC79) for open positions in my ongoing projects. 

I encourage inquiries from students at all levels and experiences, especially those from underrepresented communities.

For general interest, Check out our [lab-wide interest form](https://forms.gle/4dnhu7xtMZLJQHrE6). 

## Research & General Guidance

### UC Berkeley undergraduates, visiting students

I'm happy to chat about anything research- or academic-related. 

Swing by my drop-in office hours (listed [here](https://research.berkeley.edu/ours-peer-advisors/)) or schedule a virtual appointment with me via email. 

Feel free to send me questions or information in advance that you think may be helpful so I can provide the best guidance.
