# Mentorship 



## Research Mentorship

If you are a USC undergraduate, Mastersâ€™s student, or USC affiliate, I recruit most of the students who work on my projects, so please see this [project interest form](https://forms.gle/FQEM4d3LvAEPBmC79) for open positions in my ongoing projects. 

I encourage inquiries from students at all levels and experiences, especially those from underrepresented communities.

For general interest, Check out our [lab-wide interest form](https://forms.gle/4dnhu7xtMZLJQHrE6).
