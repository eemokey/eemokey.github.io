## Research Mentorship

If you are a USC undergraduate, Mastersâ€™s student, or USC affiliate, please see this [project interest form](https://forms.gle/FQEM4d3LvAEPBmC79) for open positions in my ongoing projects. 

I encourage inquiries from students at all levels and experiences, especially those from underrepresented communities.

For general interest, check out our [lab-wide interest form](https://forms.gle/4dnhu7xtMZLJQHrE6). 

## Research & General Guidance

I'm happy to chat about anything research- or academic-related. 

Just send me an email to arrange a meeting time!

Feel free to send me questions or relevant information in advance so I can provide the best guidance. 

If you are a UC Berkeley undergraduate, swing by my weekly drop-in office hours (listed [here](https://research.berkeley.edu/ours-peer-advisors/)). 

Catch me at [Berkeley Undergrad Research](https://research.berkeley.edu/) workshops, information sessions, and campus-wide outreach events (some of my advising resources [here](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/tag/undergrad/))!


## Google AI x Viterbi LA Community Project 

I serve as a mentor for USC's [Google AI Community Project](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/aicommunityproject/what-is-artificial-intelligence?authuser=0). 

Find us at the LA Maker Fair, Black College Success STEAM Academy AI workshop series, and other LA community events! 

If you are interested in joining us, contact Noe Mora at nmora@usc.edu!


## Ethos Project: Good Life Discussions

As the engineering facilitator, I collaborate with a philosophy PhD student to lead the [Good Life Discussions](https://stem-ed.usc.edu/our-research/eerp/ethos-project/), a discussion series for undergraduates to think more broadly about their work. 

We are working on expanding this series for PhD students (coming late Spring 2024)!  

## Engaging Girls in STEM with LA County Office of Education

From 2023-2024, I was an ambassador for the [Engaging Girls in STEM](https://www.engaginggirlsinstem.com/) program. 

I still assist with activities occasionally. 

Reach out to Anthony at Quan_Anthony@lacoe.edu to learn more.

## Viterbi Impact Program - Connecting Students with the LA Community

For the Fall 2022 semester, I was a volunteer TA for [CS@SC](https://summercamp.usc.edu/) classes through the Viterbi Impact Program ([VIP](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/involvement/viterbi-impact/)). 

There are also many other service learning opportunities in VIP!
