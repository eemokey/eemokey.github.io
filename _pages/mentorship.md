## Research Mentorship 

*Doing Cool Things with Emily*

If you are a USC undergraduate, Mastersâ€™s student, or USC affiliate, please see this [project interest form](https://forms.gle/FQEM4d3LvAEPBmC79) for open positions in my ongoing projects. 

I encourage inquiries from students at all levels and experiences, especially those from underrepresented communities.

For general interest, check out our [lab-wide interest form](https://forms.gle/4dnhu7xtMZLJQHrE6). 

## Research & General Guidance

*Expanding student access to research & scholarships*

I'm happy to chat about anything research- or academic-related. 

Just send me an email to arrange a meeting time!

If you are a UC Berkeley undergraduate, feel free to swing by my weekly drop-in office hours (listed [here](https://research.berkeley.edu/ours-peer-advisors/)). 

I'm an advisor for [Berkeley Undergraduate Research](https://research.berkeley.edu/).

Catch me at workshops, information sessions, and campus-wide outreach events (some of my advising resources [here](https://eemokey.github.io/blog/tag/undergrad/))!


## Google AI Community Project 

*Fostering curiosity & diversity in AI* 

I serve as a mentor for USC's [Google AI Community Project](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/aicommunityproject/what-is-artificial-intelligence?authuser=0). 

Find us at the [LA Maker Fair](https://losangeles.makerfaire.com/maker/entry/1586/), Black College Success STEAM Academy workshop series, Crenshaw YMCA Middle School workshop, and other LA community events! 

If you are interested in joining us, contact Noe Mora at nmora@usc.edu!


## Good Life Discussions 

*Asking big questions in a safe, supportive setting*

I collaborate with a philosophy PhD student to facilitate the [Good Life Discussions](https://stem-ed.usc.edu/our-research/eerp/ethos-project/), an [Engineering in Society](https://eis.usc.edu/) project to encourage undergraduates to think more broadly about their work. 

We are working on expanding this Ethos series for PhD students (coming late Spring 2024)!  

## Engaging Girls in STEM 

*Empowering youth in STEM & technological careers*

From 2023-2024, I was an ambassador for the [Engaging Girls in STEM](https://www.engaginggirlsinstem.com/) program. 

I still occasionally assist with activities. 

Reach out to Anthony at Quan_Anthony@lacoe.edu to learn more.

## Viterbi Impact Program  

*Connecting with the LA community*

For the Fall 2022 semester, I was a volunteer TA for [CS@SC](https://summercamp.usc.edu/) classes through the Viterbi Impact Program ([VIP](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/involvement/viterbi-impact/)). 

There are also many other service learning opportunities in VIP!
