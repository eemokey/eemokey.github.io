I was a student in MCB 50: The Immune System and Disease in Spring 2019. 

My favorite non-CS class

This page contains my whiteboard and chalkboard review matieral of each module's concepts.

Highlights can be found below
 
See all review materials in this linked google drive <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">here</a>.

These materials were created to mainly practice my board writing skills for teaching and assist with understanding, taking advantage of available boards during study hangouts (when we were actually studying). I've learned the best free chalk can be found in Wheeler
