I was a student in MCB 50: The Immune System and Disease in Spring 2019. 

My favorite non-CS class.

This page contains my whiteboard and chalkboard review matieral of each module's concepts for study group (when we were actually studying).

 Highlights can be found below (in the order of how sore my writing arm was after).
 
 All of my review materials can be found in my linked google drive <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">here</a>.
